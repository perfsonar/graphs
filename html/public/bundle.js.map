For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

The object may contained nested data.\n\n * an Immutable.Map\n\n * a simple type such as an integer. This is a shorthand for supplying {\"value\": v}.\n\n**Example:**\n\nGiven some source of data that looks like this:\n\n```json\nconst sampleEvent = {\n    \"start_time\": \"2015-04-22T03:30:00Z\",\n    \"end_time\": \"2015-04-22T13:00:00Z\",\n    \"description\": \"At 13:33 pacific circuit 06519 went down.\",\n    \"title\": \"STAR-CR5 - Outage\",\n    \"completed\": true,\n    \"external_ticket\": \"\",\n    \"esnet_ticket\": \"ESNET-20150421-013\",\n    \"organization\": \"Internet2 / Level 3\",\n    \"type\": \"U\"\n}\n```\n\nWe first extract the begin and end times to build a TimeRange:\n\n```js\nlet b = new Date(sampleEvent.start_time);\nlet e = new Date(sampleEvent.end_time);\nlet timerange = new TimeRange(b, e);\n```\n\nThen we combine the TimeRange and the event itself to create the Event.\n\n```js\nlet outageEvent = new TimeRangeEvent(timerange, sampleEvent);\n```\n\nOnce we have an event we can get access the time range with:\n\n```js\noutageEvent.begin().getTime()   // 1429673400000\noutageEvent.end().getTime())    // 1429707600000\noutageEvent.humanizeDuration()) // \"10 hours\"\n```\n\nAnd we can access the data like so:\n\n```js\noutageEvent.get(\"title\")  // \"STAR-CR5 - Outage\"\n```\n\nOr use:\n\n```js\noutageEvent.data()\n```\n\nto fetch the whole data object, which will be an Immutable Map.\n*/\n\nvar Event = function () {\n\n    /**\n     * The creation of an Event is done by combining two parts:\n     * the timestamp and the data.\n     *\n     * To construct you specify the timestamp as either:\n     *     - Javascript Date object\n     *     - a Moment, or\n     *     - millisecond timestamp: the number of ms since the UNIX epoch\n     *\n     * To specify the data you can supply either:\n     *     - a Javascript object containing key values pairs\n     *     - an Immutable.Map, or\n     *     - a simple type such as an integer.

There are two basic types:\n * *Multiplier index* - the number of some unit of time (hours, days etc) since the UNIX epoch.\n * *Calendar index* - The second represents a calendar range, such as Oct 2014.\n\nFor the first type, a multiplier index, an example might be:\n\n```text\n    1d-12355      //  30th Oct 2003 (GMT), the 12355th day since the UNIX epoch\n```\n\nYou can also use seconds (e.g. 30s), minutes (e.g. 5m), hours (e.g. 1h) or days (e.g. 7d).\n\nHere are several examples of a calendar index:\n\n```text\n    2003-10-30    // 30th Oct 2003\n    2014-09       // Sept 2014\n    2015          // All of the year 2015\n```\n\nAn Index is a nice representation of certain types of time intervals because it can be cached with its string representation as a key. A specific chunk of time, and associated data can be looked up based on that string. It also allows us to represent things like months, which have variable length.\n\nAn Index is also useful when collecting into specific time ranges, for example generating all the 5 min (\"5m\") maximum rollups within a specific day (\"1d\"). See the processing section within these docs.\n\n */\n\nvar Index = function () {\n    function Index(s) {\n        var utc = arguments.length <= 1 || arguments[1] === undefined ? true : arguments[1];\n        (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, Index);\n\n        this._utc = utc;\n        this._string = s;\n        this._timerange = _util2.default.rangeFromIndexString(s, this._utc);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Returns the Index as JSON, which will just be its string\n     * representation\n     */\n\n\n    (0, _createClass3.default)(Index, [{\n        key: \"toJSON\",\n        value: function toJSON() {\n            return this._string;\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Simply returns the Index as its string\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"toString\",\n        value: function toString() {\n            return this._string;\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * for the calendar range style Indexes, this lets you return\n         * that calendar range as a human readable format, e.g. \"June, 2014\".\n         * The format specified is a Moment.format.\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"toNiceString\",\n        value: function toNiceString(format) {\n            return _util2.default.niceIndexString(this._string, format);\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Alias for toString()\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"asString\",\n        value: function asString() {\n            return this.toString();\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Returns the Index as a TimeRange\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"asTimerange\",\n        value: function asTimerange() {\n            return this._timerange;\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Returns the start date of the Index\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"begin\",\n        value: function begin() {\n            return this._timerange.begin();\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Returns the end date of the Index\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"end\",\n        value: function end() {\n            return this._timerange.end();\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Return the index string given an index prefix and a datetime object.\n         */\n\n    }], [{\n        key: \"getIndexString\",\n        value: function getIndexString(win, date) {\n            var pos = _util2.default.windowPositionFromDate(win, date);\n            return win + \"-\" + pos;\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Given the time range, return a list of strings of index values every <prefix> tick.\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"getIndexStringList\",\n        value: function getIndexStringList(win, timerange) {\n            var pos1 = _util2.default.windowPositionFromDate(win, timerange.begin());\n            var pos2 = _util2.default.windowPositionFromDate(win, timerange.end());\n            var indexList = [];\n            if (pos1 <= pos2) {\n                for (var pos = pos1; pos <= pos2; pos++) {\n                    indexList.push(win + \"-\" + pos);\n                }\n            }\n            return indexList;\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Generate an index string with day granularity.\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"getDailyIndexString\",\n        value: function getDailyIndexString(date) {\n            var utc = arguments.length <= 1 || arguments[1] === undefined ?

Each row is at a different time (or timerange), and each value corresponds to the column labels.\n   \nAs just hinted at, the first column may actually be:\n\n - \"time\"\n - \"timeRange\" represented by a `TimeRange`\n - \"index\" - a time range represented by an `Index`. By using an index it is possible, for example, to refer to a specific month:\n\n```javascript\nvar availabilityData = {\n    name: \"Last 3 months availability\",\n    columns: [\"index\", \"uptime\"],\n    points: [\n        [\"2015-06\", \"100%\"], // <-- 2015-06 specified here represents June 2015\n        [\"2015-05\", \"92%\"],\n        [\"2015-04\", \"87%\"],\n    ]\n};\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can construct a `TimeSeries` with a list of events. These may be `Events`, `TimeRangeEvents` or `IndexedEvents`. Here's an example of that:\n\n```javascript\nconst events = [];\nevents.push(new Event(new Date(2015, 7, 1), {value: 27}));\nevents.push(new Event(new Date(2015, 8, 1), {value: 29}));\nconst series = new TimeSeries({\n    name: \"avg temps\",\n    events: events\n});\n```\n\n### Nested data\n\nThe values do not have to be simple types like the above examples. Here's an example where each value is itself an object with \"in\" and \"out\" keys:\n\n```javascript\nconst series = new TimeSeries({\n    name: \"Map Traffic\",\n    columns: [\"time\", \"NASA_north\", \"NASA_south\"],\n    points: [\n        [1400425951000, {in: 100, out: 200}, {in: 145, out: 135}],\n        [1400425952000, {in: 200, out: 400}, {in: 146, out: 142}],\n        [1400425953000, {in: 300, out: 600}, {in: 147, out: 158}],\n        [1400425954000, {in: 400, out: 800}, {in: 155, out: 175}],\n    ]\n});\n```\n\nComplex data is stored in an Immutable structure. To get a value out of nested data like this you will get the Event you want (by row), as usual, and then use `get()` to fetch the value by column name. The result of this call will be a JSON copy of the Immutable data so you can query deeper in the usual way:\n\n```javascript\nseries.at(0).get(\"NASA_north\")[\"in\"]  // 200`\n```\n\nIt is then possible to use a value mapper function when calculating different properties. For example, to get the average \"in\" value of the NASA_north column:\n\n```javascript\nseries.avg(\"NASA_north\", d => d.in);  // 250\n```\n */\n\nvar TimeSeries = function () {\n    function TimeSeries(arg) {\n        var _this = this;\n\n        (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, TimeSeries);\n\n        this._collection = null; // Collection\n        this._data = null; // Meta data\n\n        if (arg instanceof TimeSeries) {\n\n            //\n            // Copy another TimeSeries\n            //\n\n            var other = arg;\n            this._data = other._data;\n            this._collection = other._collection;\n        } else if (_underscore2.default.isObject(arg)) {\n\n            //\n            // TimeSeries(object data) where data may be:\n            //    { \"events\": [event-1, event-2, ..., event-n]}\n            // or\n            //    { \"columns\": [time|timerange|index, column-1, ..., column-n]\n            //      \"points\": [\n            //         [t1, v1, v2, ..., v2],\n            //         [t2, v1, v2, ..., vn],\n            //         ...\n            //      ]\n            //    }\n\n            var obj = arg;\n\n            if (_underscore2.default.has(obj, \"events\")) {\n\n                //\n                // Initialized from an event list\n                //\n\n                var events = obj.events;\n                var meta1 = (0, _objectWithoutProperties3.default)(obj, [\"events\"]); //eslint-disable-line\n\n                this._collection = new _collection2.default(events);\n                this._data = buildMetaData(meta1);\n            } else if (_underscore2.default.has(obj, \"collection\")) {\n\n                //\n                // Initialized from a Collection\n                //\n\n                var collection = obj.collection;\n                var meta3 = (0, _objectWithoutProperties3.default)(obj, [\"collection\"]); //eslint-disable-line\n\n                this._collection = collection;\n                this._data = buildMetaData(meta3);\n            } else if (_underscore2.default.has(obj, \"columns\") && _underscore2.default.has(obj, \"points\")) {\n                (function () {\n\n                    //\n                    // Initialized from the wire format\n                    //\n\n                    var columns = obj.columns;\n                    var points = obj.points;\n                    var _obj$utc = obj.utc;\n                    var utc = _obj$utc === undefined ?

This\n * series can contain multiple columns and those columns can be referenced using the `columns`\n * prop. The `columns` props allows you to map columns in the series to the chart,\n * letting you specify the stacking and orientation of the data. In the above example\n * we map the \"in\" column in `trafficSeries` to the up direction and the \"out\" column to\n * the down direction. Each direction is specified as an array, so adding multiple\n * columns into a direction will stack the areas in that direction.\n *\n * Note: It is recommended that `<ChartContainer>`s be placed within a <Resizable> tag,\n * rather than hard coding the width as in the above example.\n */\nexports.default = _react2.default.createClass({\n\n    displayName: \"AreaChart\",\n\n    propTypes: {\n\n        /**\n         * What [Pond TimeSeries](http://software.es.net/pond#timeseries) data to visualize\n         */\n        series: _react2.default.PropTypes.instanceOf(_pondjs.TimeSeries).isRequired,\n\n        /**\n         * Reference to the axis which provides the vertical scale for ## drawing. e.g.\n         * specifying axis=\"trafficRate\" would refer the y-scale to the YAxis of id=\"trafficRate\".\n         */\n        axis: _react2.default.PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n\n        /**\n         * The series series columns mapped to stacking up and down.\n         * Has the format:\n         * ```\n         *  \"columns\": {\n         *      up: [\"in\", ...],\n         *      down: [\"out\", ...]\n         *  }\n         *  ```\n         */\n        columns: _react2.default.PropTypes.shape({\n            up: _react2.default.PropTypes.arrayOf(_react2.default.PropTypes.string),\n            down: _react2.default.PropTypes.arrayOf(_react2.default.PropTypes.string)\n        }),\n\n        stack: _react2.default.PropTypes.bool,\n\n        /**\n         * The styles to apply to the underlying SVG lines.

charts in that it will render across a the time range of the event\n * rather than rendering to specific categories. As a result,\n * a Aug-2014 bar will render between the Aug 2014 tick mark and the Sept 2014\n * tickmark.\n *\n * The BarChart will render a single TimeSeries. You can specify the columns\n * you want to render with the `columns` prop. Each column will be stacked on\n * the other, in the order specified in the `columns` array.\n *\n * The BarChart supports selection of individual bars. To control this use\n * `onSelectionChange` to get a callback of selection changed. Your callback\n * will be called with with the selection (and object containing the event\n * and column). You can pass this back into the BarChart as `selection`. For\n * example:\n *\n * ```\n *  <BarChart\n *      ...\n *      selection={this.state.selection}\n *      onSelectionChange={selection => this.setState({selection})} />\n * ```\n *\n * Similarly you can monitor which bar is being hovered over with the\n * `onHighlightChanged` callback. This can be used to determine the info text\n * to display. Info text will display a box (like a tooltip) with a line\n * connecting it to the bar. You use the `info` prop to evoke this and to\n * supply the text for the info box. See the styling notes below for more\n * information on this.\n *\n * ### Styling\n *\n * A BarChart supports per-column or per-event styling. Styles can be set for\n * each of the four states that are possible for each event: normal, highlighted,\n * selected and muted. To style per-column, supply an object. For per-event styling\n * supply a function: `(event, column) => {}` The functon will return a style object.\n *\n * See the `style` prop in the API documentation for more information.\n *\n * Separately the size of the bars can be controlled with the `spacing` and\n * `offset` props. Spacing controls the gap between the bars. Offset moves the\n * bars left or right by the given number of pixels. You can use this to place\n * bars along side each other. Alternatively, you can give each column a fixed width\n * using the `size` prop. In this case this size will be used over the size\n * determined from the timerange of the event and the `spacing`.\n *\n * The highlight info for each bar is also able to be styled using the `infoStyle`.\n * This enables you to control the drawing of the box, connecting lines and dot.\n * Using the `infoWidth` and `infoHeight` props you can control the size of the\n * box, which is fixed. For the info inside the box, it's up to you: it can either\n * be a simple string or an array of {label, value} pairs.\n */\nexports.default = _react2.default.createClass({\n\n    displayName: \"BarChart\",\n\n    getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n        return {\n            columns: [\"value\"],\n            spacing: 1.0,\n            offset: 0,\n            infoStyle: {\n                line: {\n                    stroke: \"#999\",\n                    cursor: \"crosshair\",\n                    pointerEvents: \"none\"\n                },\n                box: {\n                    fill: \"white\",\n                    opacity: 0.90,\n                    stroke: \"#999\",\n                    pointerEvents: \"none\"\n                },\n                dot: {\n                    fill: \"#999\"\n                }\n            },\n            infoWidth: 90,\n            infoHeight: 30\n        };\n    },\n\n\n    propTypes: {\n\n        /**\n         * What [Pond TimeSeries](http://software.es.net/pond#timeseries)\n         * data to visualize\n         */\n        series: _react2.default.PropTypes.instanceOf(_pondjs.TimeSeries).isRequired,\n\n        /**\n         * The distance in pixels to inset the bar chart from its actual timerange\n         */\n        spacing: _react2.default.PropTypes.number,\n\n        /**\n         * The distance in pixels to offset the bar from its center position within the timerange\n         * it represents\n         */\n        offset: _react2.default.PropTypes.number,\n\n        /**\n         * A list of columns within the series that will be stacked on top of each other\n         */\n        columns: _react2.default.PropTypes.arrayOf(_react2.default.PropTypes.string),\n\n        /**\n         * The style of the bar chart drawing (using SVG CSS properties).\n         * This is an object with a key for each column which is being drawn,\n         * per the `columns` prop.

A YAxis always appears within a `ChartRow`, from\n * which it gets its height and positioning. You can have more than\n * one axis per row.\n *\n * Here's a simple YAxis example:\n *\n * ```js\n * <YAxis\n *     id=\"price-axis\"\n *     label=\"Price (USD)\"\n *     min={0} max={100}\n *     width=\"60\"\n *     type=\"linear\"\n *     format=\"$,.2f\" />\n * ```\n *\n * Visually you can control the axis `label`, its size via the `width`\n * prop, its `format`, and `type` of scale (linear).\n *\n * Each axis also defines a scale through a `min` and `max` prop. Charts\n * may then refer to the axis by by citing the axis `id` in their `axis`\n * prop. Those charts will then use the axis scale for their y-scale.\n *\n * Here is an example of two line charts that each have their own axis:\n *\n * ```js\n * <ChartContainer timeRange={audSeries.timerange()}>\n *     <ChartRow height=\"200\">\n *         <YAxis id=\"aud\" label=\"AUD\" min={0.5} max={1.5} width=\"60\" type=\"linear\" format=\"$,.2f\"/>\n *         <Charts>\n *             <LineChart axis=\"aud\" series={audSeries} style={audStyle}/>\n *             <LineChart axis=\"euro\" series={euroSeries} style={euroStyle}/>\n *         </Charts>\n *         <YAxis id=\"euro\" label=\"Euro\" min={0.5} max={1.5} width=\"80\" type=\"linear\" format=\"$,.2f\"/>\n *     </ChartRow>\n * </ChartContainer>\n * ```\n *\n *  Note that there are two `<YAxis>` components defined here, one before\n *  the `<Charts>` block and one after.

As an example, let's say we have a set of interfaces, which\ntogether carry the entire network traffic to a particular location. We want to see which\ninterfaces contribute the most to the total traffic.\n\nTo display this we render the HorizontalBarChart in our page:\n \n    <HorizontalBarChart\n        display=\"range\"\n        seriesList={interfaces}\n        columns={[\"out\", \"in\"]}\n        top={5} sortBy=\"max\"\n        timestamp={this.state.tracker}\n        format={formatter}\n        selected={this.state.selected}\n        onSelectionChanged={this.handleSelectionChange}\n        selectionColor=\"#37B6D3\"\n        style={[{fill: \"#1F78B4\"}, {fill: \"#FF7F00\"}]} />\n\nOur first prop `display` tells the component how to draw the bars. In this case we use the\n\"range\", which will draw from min to max (with additional drawing to show 1 stdev away from\nthe center).\n\nNext we specify the `seriesList` itself. This should be an array of Pond TimeSeries objects.\n\nThe `columns` prop tells us which columns within the TimeSeries should be displayed as a bar.\nIn this case we have `in` and `out` traffic columns, so we'll get two bars for each series.\n\n`top` and `sortBy` are used to order and trim the list of TimeSeries. Here we order by the max\nvalues in the specified columns, then just display the top 5.\n\nThe `timestamp` lets the component know the current value. You could display the last timestamp\nin the series, or perhaps a time being interacted with in the UI.\n\nThe `format` can either be a d3 format string of a function. In this case we have our own\nformatter function to display values:\n\n    function formatter(value) {\n        const prefix = d3.formatPrefix(value);\n        return `${prefix.scale(value).toFixed()} ${prefix.symbol}bps`;\n    }\n\nSelection is handled with `selected`, which gives the name of the TimeSeries currently selected.\nIf the user selects a different row the callback passed to `onSelectionChanged` will be called\nwith the name of the TimeSeries represented in the newly selected row. We also specify a color\nto mark the selected item with the `selectionColor` prop.\n\nNext we specify the `style`. This is the css style of each column's bars. Typically you would\njust want to specify the fill color. Each bar is a svg rect.\n\n*/\nexports.default = _react2.default.createClass({\n\n    displayName: \"HorizontalBarChart\",\n\n    propTypes: {\n\n        /**\n         * Sort by either \"max\", \"avg\" or \"name\"\n         */\n        display: _react2.default.PropTypes.oneOf([\"avg\", \"max\", \"range\"]),\n\n        /**\n         * A list of [TimeSeries](http://software.es.net/pond#timeseries) objects to visualize\n         */\n        seriesList: _react2.default.PropTypes.arrayOf(_react2.default.PropTypes.instanceOf(_pondjs.TimeSeries)).isRequired,\n\n        /**\n         * Columns in each timeseries to display\n         */\n        columns: _react2.default.PropTypes.arrayOf(_react2.default.PropTypes.string),\n\n        /**\n         * Sort by either \"name\", \"max\", or \"avg\"\n         */\n        sortBy: _react2.default.PropTypes.oneOf([\"name\", \"max\", \"avg\"]),\n\n        /**\n         * Display only the top n\n         */\n        top: _react2.default.PropTypes.number,\n\n        /**\n         * The height or thickness of each bar\n         */\n        size: _react2.default.PropTypes.number,\n\n        /**\n         * The spacing between each bar (column) of the series\n         */\n        spacing: _react2.default.PropTypes.number,\n\n        /**\n         * The spacing above and below each series\n         */\n        padding: _react2.default.PropTypes.number,\n\n        /**\n         * The width of the label area\n         */\n        labelWidth: _react2.default.PropTypes.number,\n\n        /**\n         * Callback for when the selection changes.

This is\n * useful when hovering over another chart on the page, or to display\n * the current value of live data. You can see this defined in the\n * above categories.\n *\n * The legend can also be supplied with callback functions which will\n * tell you if the user has clicked or hovered over on one of the legend\n * items. You can use this to sync highlighting and selection to a\n * chart.\n *\n * ## Styling\n *\n * There are three methods of styling a legend:\n *  - using a Styler object\n *  - using an object containing inline styles\n *  - using a function which returns an inline style\n *\n * A Styler object can be supplied directly to the `style` prop\n * of the legend. This is the simplest approach, since you can\n * usually just use the same Styler as you use for your chart.\n *\n * Supplying an object to the `style` prop gives you more control\n * than the Styler, since you can provide the actual CSS properties\n * for each element of the legend. The format for the object is:\n *\n * ```\n * {\n *     columnName1: {\n            symbol: {\n                normal: {...styleSymbol},\n                highlighted: {...styleSymbol},\n                selected: {...styleSymbol},\n                muted: {...styleSymbol}\n            },\n            label: {\n                normal: {...labelStyle},\n                highlighted: {...labelStyle},\n                selected: {...labelStyle},\n                muted: {...labelStyle}\n            },\n            value: {\n                normal: {...valueStyle},\n                highlighted: {...valueStyle},\n                selected: {...valueStyle},\n                muted: {...valueStyle}\n            }\n *     },\n *     columnName2 : {\n *         ...\n *     },\n *     ...\n *  }\n *\n *  - symbolStyle is the CSS properties for the symbol, which\n * is either a swatch, dot or line. For a line, you'd want to\n * provide the SVG <line> properties, for a swatch you'd provide\n * the SVG <rect> properties and for a dot the <ellipse> properties.\n *  - labelStyle is the main label for the legend item. It is a\n *  SVG <text> element, so you can control the font properties.\n *  - valueStyle is the optional value. As with the labelStyle you\n *  this is an SVG <text> element.\n *\n * Finally, you can provide a function to the `style` prop. This\n * is similar to providing an object, except your function will\n * be called with the columnName and you should return the map\n * containing symbol, label and value styles.\n */\n/**\n *  Copyright (c) 2015-2016, The Regents of the University of California,\n *  through Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (subject to receipt\n *  of any required approvals from the U.S. Dept. of Energy).\n *  All rights reserved.\n *\n *  This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n *  LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n */\n\nexports.default = _react2.default.createClass({\n\n    displayName: \"Legend\",\n\n    getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n        return {\n            style: {},\n            labelStyle: {},\n            type: \"swatch\", // or \"line\" or \"dot\"\n            align: \"left\",\n            width: 16,\n            height: 16\n        };\n    },\n\n\n    propTypes: {\n\n        /**\n         * The overall style of the legend items, either a color \"swatch\", a\n         * colored \"line\", or a \"dot\".\n         */\n        type: _react2.default.PropTypes.oneOf([\"swatch\", \"line\", \"dot\"]),\n\n        /**\n         * Alignment of the legend within the available space.

axis.\n *\n * The ScatterChart should be used within `<ChartContainer>` etc.,\n * as this will construct the horizontal and vertical axis, and\n * manage other elements. As with other charts, this lets them be stacked or\n * overlaid on top of each other.\n *\n * A custom info overlay lets you hover over the data and examine points. Points\n * can be selected or highlighted.\n *\n * ```\n * <ChartContainer timeRange={series.timerange()}>\n *     <ChartRow height=\"150\">\n *         <YAxis id=\"wind\" label=\"Wind gust (mph)\" labelOffset={-5}\n *                min={0} max={series.max()} width=\"100\" type=\"linear\" format=\",.1f\"/>\n *         <Charts>\n *             <ScatterChart axis=\"wind\" series={series} style={{color: \"steelblue\", opacity: 0.5}} />\n *         </Charts>\n *     </ChartRow>\n * </ChartContainer>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Styling\n *\n * A scatter chart supports per-column or per-event styling. Styles can be set for\n * each of the four states that are possible for each event: normal, highlighted,\n * selected or muted. To style per-column, supply an object. For per-event styling\n * supply a function: `(event, column) => {}` The functon will return a style object.\n * See the `style` prop in the API documentation for more information.\n *\n * Separately the size of the dots can be controlled with the `radius` prop. This\n * can either be a fixed value (e.g. 2.0), or a function. If a function is supplied\n * it will be called as `(event, column) => {}` and should return the size.\n *\n * The hover info for each point is also able to be styled using the info style.\n * This enables you to control the drawing of the box and connecting lines. Using\n * the `infoWidth` and `infoHeight` props you can control the size of the box, which\n * is fixed.\n */\nexports.default = _react2.default.createClass({\n\n    displayName: \"ScatterChart\",\n\n    getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n        return {\n            columns: [\"value\"],\n            radius: 2.0,\n            infoStyle: {\n                line: {\n                    stroke: \"#999\",\n                    cursor: \"crosshair\",\n                    pointerEvents: \"none\"\n                },\n                box: {\n                    fill: \"white\",\n                    opacity: 0.90,\n                    stroke: \"#999\",\n                    pointerEvents: \"none\"\n                }\n            },\n            infoWidth: 90,\n            infoHeight: 30\n        };\n    },\n\n\n    propTypes: {\n\n        /**\n         * What [Pond TimeSeries](http://software.es.net/pond#timeseries) data to visualize\n         */\n        series: _react2.default.PropTypes.instanceOf(_pondjs.TimeSeries).isRequired,\n\n        /**\n         * Which columns of the series to render\n         */\n        columns: _react2.default.PropTypes.arrayOf(_react2.default.PropTypes.string),\n\n        /**\n         * Reference to the axis which provides the vertical scale for drawing. e.g.\n         * specifying axis=\"trafficRate\" would refer the y-scale to the YAxis of id=\"trafficRate\".\n         */\n        axis: _react2.default.PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n\n        /**\n         * The radius of the points in the scatter chart.\n         *\n         * If this is a number it will be used as the radius for every point.\n         * If this is a function it will be called for each event.\n         *\n         * The function is called with the event and the column name and must return a number.\n         *\n         * For example this function will use the radius column of the event:\n         *\n         * ```\n         * const radius = (event, column) => {\n         *    return event.get(\"radius\");\n         * }\n         * ```\n         */\n        radius: _react2.default.PropTypes.oneOfType([_react2.default.PropTypes.number, _react2.default.PropTypes.func, _react2.default.PropTypes.instanceOf(_styler.Styler)]),\n\n        /**\n         * The style of the scatter chart drawing (using SVG CSS properties).\n         * This is an object with a key for each column which is being plotted,\n         * per the `columns` prop.
